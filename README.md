> **For players:** there is no game to download yet. A matched-save replay created a test pilot, selected “HAI SHI DAO 2080 [NORMAL],” and reached “NOW LOADING.” It remained there for about four minutes until the ten-minute run ended, without reaching gameplay. The guest continued issuing graphics work, so this does not prove a permanent hang. Earlier routes have stalled or diverged at different startup screens, so this route is not yet reliable. These diagnostics used a synthetic DSP acknowledgement; audible audio is not verified. There is no installer or launcher. Please do not send game files.

## What this project is

The goal is to translate the original Xbox version of *Steel Battalion* (2002) ahead of time into a Windows application and recreate the Xbox services it needs. This is called **static recompilation**. The project is not an emulator packaged under another name.

The translated Windows program builds, but it is not reliable or playable. The initial graphics stall was traced to a missing launch setting: selecting the DMA walker alone does not execute commands; enabling its executor lets the first ring advance. A virtual Steel Battalion controller route has now visibly progressed through pilot creation, difficulty selection, and the `NOW LOADING` screen. A 600-second diagnostic run still ended at the configured watchdog with no mission frame; its guest continued file-system and graphics work, so this is not yet proof of a permanent hang. File-load throughput and invalid indirect-call targets need investigation. Audio output, playable mission behavior, physical controller support, and campaign completion remain unverified. The detailed tracker records evidence and limits for each run.

## Controller compatibility

The original 40-button Steel Battalion controller and pedals are central compatibility targets, alongside keyboard, mouse, gamepad, HOTAS, and custom controller profiles. A virtual-device test verified the 26-byte Main Weapon report and a corresponding guest action-state change. In the pilot-name editor, a scripted left-stick input visibly moved the selected letter from A to B; the direction mapping still needs a matched up/down check. No complete control scheme or in-game response is verified.

## What you can do here

- **Learn the current state:** read the [player guide](docs/PLAYER_GUIDE.md) and [project progress tracker](docs/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md).
- **Follow the technical work:** see [research and architecture](docs/milestone-1-research.md) and the [audio DSP integration plan](docs/audio-dsp-integration-plan.md).
- **Share community knowledge:** visit [Steel Battalion Online on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/steelbattaliononline/) or the [community Discord](https://discord.gg/steelbattalion).

When a tested release exists, players will need to provide their own legally obtained game copy. This repository will not include the ISO, XBE, extracted game code, textures, audio, or cinematics. The planned launcher may offer an option to add the game to Steam as a non-Steam shortcut; it will not grant a Steam store license.

## Progress at a glance

| Work area | Progress | Current result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overall project milestones | [#####---------------] 2/8 | Milestone 3, boot and compatibility, remains active. The matched-save virtual controller route reached “NOW LOADING” and remained there for about four minutes in a ten-minute run; no mission frame appeared. Mission gameplay is not verified. |
| Research and architecture | [#-------------------] 3/3 | Approach and technical limits documented. |
| XBE analysis and decompilation | [##########----------] 2/4 | XBE parsing and ahead-of-time translation output are available; per-function correctness and complete runtime dependencies are not yet verified. |
| Initial code translation | [#-------------------] 100% | Translation output exists; correctness is not established by output count. |
| Windows build | [#-------------------] 100% | A local build completes. |
| Boot and compatibility | [########------------] 4/5 | Captured 640×480 frames show the title prompt, pilot creation, date confirmation, difficulty selection, and “NOW LOADING.” The latest matched-save route remained at the loading screen for about four minutes before the ten-minute run ended; mission gameplay remains unverified. |
| 60-FPS mission performance | [--------------------] 0/1 | No playable mission frame or gameplay frame-time sample has been verified; startup/loading measurements do not count. |
| Startup rendering performance | [##########----------] 2/4 | Earlier lower-overhead presentation fell to about 1.1 FPS. An instrumented windowed run reached 86 flips and reported 8.12 FPS; two 65-second windowed runs reached 765–767 flips and reported 7.83–7.84 FPS. The latest matched-save run lasted about ten minutes total, including about four minutes at “NOW LOADING”; its last report was 0.56 guest FPS and 358,446 CPU-rasterized triangles. No playable mission frame was captured. Startup/loading figures are not a gameplay benchmark; stable frame pacing remains unverified. |
| CPU raster throughput | [##########----------] 2/4 | Four workers remain the measured default; a synthetic sweep found no benefit from 8–16 workers. The local clipping fast path and raster regression harness have synthetic-only evidence; mission frame time and 1% lows are unverified. |
| GPU scene rendering | [#####---------------] 1/4 | Vulkan presentation and a narrow splash-render path use the RTX 4070 SUPER. General NV2A scene rasterization still runs on CPU; sampled `nvidia-smi` readings were 0% during the title/loading route. Mission GPU-engine use and accelerated-scene image parity are unverified. |
| Virtual controller input | [#############-------] 2/3 | Virtual Main Weapon accepted pilot/menu confirmation; analog left-stick directions moved the pilot-name selection across rows and fields. D-pad right did not move this editor's cursor. Physical adapter compatibility and full original controller mapping/outputs remain unverified. |
| Guest DSP and audio | [█-------------------] 1/2 | Nonzero packets reach the DirectSound stream processor, XMO returns success, and the deferred callback reaches XBE routine `0x00227F9C`. A separate capture reproduced the invalid release argument in an audio callback while draining a DPC-managed list. The corrected loading run did not reach that same cleanup path, and audible output remains unverified. |
| Campaign, controller, launcher | [--------------------] | Not yet verified or available. |

## Who makes this?

Most of the research, code, and documentation in this repository have been produced with **ChatGPT Codex**. GitHub maintainer and project contact: [@cstout816](https://github.com/cstout816). This is a community preservation effort; reported progress separates completed engineering work from game behavior that has actually been verified.

## Technical approach

The project uses [sp00nznet/xboxrecomp](https://github.com/sp00nznet/xboxrecomp) for ahead-of-time Xbox x86 translation; it does not use full-system emulation. The graphics work currently reproduces a narrow splash-logo draw, while general graphics, kernel, audio, filesystem, controller, and campaign compatibility still need work. See the [development tracker](docs/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md) for what has actually been verified.

The work prioritizes campaign reliability and the original Steel Battalion controller before visual enhancements. See the [community compatibility and preservation plan](docs/community-compatibility-preservation.md) for planned controller support, campaign checks, accessibility, and future Line of Contact research.

## Performance and hardware use

  The runtime uses CPU worker threads for general Xbox graphics rasterization and the RTX 4070 SUPER for presentation and a small, verified GPU-rendered splash draw. A previous runtime log confirms the NVIDIA card was selected. The available synthetic raster test was fastest with 4–6 workers; 8–16 workers did not improve it, so the current 4-worker default stays in place until a repeatable mission benchmark supports changing it. A verified CPU fast path reduced a repeated raster test's median process time by about 1.9%; its effect on game frames is unmeasured. A four-worker matched-save run reached `NOW LOADING` at about 0.56–0.60 guest FPS, but did not show a mission frame. A later six-worker retry froze at the title after 535 flips; per-process GPU 3D samples reached about 25% during startup and fell to 0% while the title was frozen. These startup/loading readings are not gameplay benchmarks. The full scene is not yet GPU-rendered; gameplay GPU utilization or 60 FPS has not been verified.
