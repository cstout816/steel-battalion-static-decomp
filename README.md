> **For players:** there is no game to download yet. Two visible replays created a test pilot with the virtual Steel Battalion controls, selected “HAI SHI DAO 2080 [NORMAL],” and reached “NOW LOADING.” Both stayed on that screen for about three minutes. A retry with the extracted `TEX00.BIN` copied into its private test cache also stalled, so that file alone is not a fix. A later repeat diverged earlier at the pilot-name screen, and a trace-enabled repeat timed out on a black screen in the D3D completion wait; the route is not reliable yet. No run reached gameplay. These diagnostics used a synthetic DSP acknowledgement; audible audio is not verified. There is no installer or launcher. Please do not send game files.

## What this project is

The goal is to translate the original Xbox version of *Steel Battalion* (2002) ahead of time into a Windows application and recreate the Xbox services it needs. This is called **static recompilation**. The project is not an emulator packaged under another name.

The translated Windows program builds, but it is not reliable or playable. The initial graphics stall was traced to a missing launch setting: selecting the DMA walker alone does not execute commands; enabling its executor lets the first ring advance. A virtual Steel Battalion controller route has now visibly progressed through pilot creation, difficulty selection, and the `NOW LOADING` screen. A 600-second diagnostic run still ended at the configured watchdog with no mission frame; its guest continued file-system and graphics work, so this is not yet proof of a permanent hang. File-load throughput and invalid indirect-call targets need investigation. Audio output, playable mission behavior, physical controller support, and campaign completion remain unverified. The detailed tracker records evidence and limits for each run.

## Controller compatibility

The original 40-button Steel Battalion controller and pedals are central compatibility targets, alongside keyboard, mouse, gamepad, HOTAS, and custom controller profiles. A virtual-device test verified the 26-byte Main Weapon report and a corresponding guest action-state change. In the pilot-name editor, a scripted left-stick input visibly moved the selected letter from A to B; the direction mapping still needs a matched up/down check. No complete control scheme or in-game response is verified.

## What you can do here

- **Learn the current state:** read the [player guide](docs/PLAYER_GUIDE.md) and [project progress tracker](docs/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md).
- **Follow the technical work:** see [research and architecture](docs/milestone-1-research.md) and the [audio DSP integration plan](docs/audio-dsp-integration-plan.md).
- **Share community knowledge:** visit [Steel Battalion Online on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/steelbattaliononline/) or the [community Discord](https://discord.gg/steelbattalion).

When a tested release exists, players will need to provide their own legally obtained game copy. This repository will not include the ISO, XBE, extracted game code, textures, audio, or cinematics. The planned launcher may offer an option to add the game to Steam as a non-Steam shortcut; it will not grant a Steam store license.

## Progress at a glance

| Work area | Progress | Current result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overall project milestones | [#####---------------] 2/8 | Milestone 3, boot and compatibility, remains active. The virtual controller route confirms pilot creation and selection of “HAI SHI DAO 2080 [NORMAL]”; the latest 600-second run reached “NOW LOADING” but did not show a mission frame. Mission gameplay is not verified. |
| Research and architecture | [#-------------------] 3/3 | Approach and technical limits documented. |
| XBE analysis and decompilation | [##########----------] 2/4 | XBE parsing and ahead-of-time translation output are available; per-function correctness and complete runtime dependencies are not yet verified. |
| Initial code translation | [#-------------------] 100% | Translation output exists; correctness is not established by output count. |
| Windows build | [#-------------------] 100% | A local build completes. |
| Boot and compatibility | [########------------] 4/5 | Captured 640×480 frames show the title prompt, pilot creation, date confirmation, difficulty selection, and “NOW LOADING.” The adaptive virtual-controller route is repeatable through mission selection, but the 600-second diagnostic bound ended before a mission frame; mission gameplay remains unverified. |
| 60-FPS mission performance | [--------------------] 0/1 | No playable mission frame or gameplay frame-time sample has been verified; startup/loading measurements do not count. |
| Startup rendering performance | [##########----------] 2/4 | Earlier lower-overhead presentation fell to about 1.1 FPS. An instrumented windowed run reached 86 flips and reported 8.12 FPS; two 65-second windowed runs reached 765–767 flips and reported 7.83–7.84 FPS. A later 600-second mission-loading replay remained at “NOW LOADING”; its final CPU-raster report was about 0.59 FPS, 355,302 triangles, and 1.92 billion pixel writes. No playable mission frame was captured. These startup/loading measurements are not a gameplay benchmark; stable frame pacing remains unverified. |
| Virtual controller input | [#############-------] 2/3 | Virtual Main Weapon accepted pilot/menu confirmation; analog left-stick directions moved the pilot-name selection across rows and fields. D-pad right did not move this editor's cursor. Physical adapter compatibility and full original controller mapping/outputs remain unverified. |
| Guest DSP and audio | [█-------------------] 1/2 | Nonzero packets reach the DirectSound stream processor, XMO returns success, and the deferred callback reaches XBE routine `0x00227F9C`. A separate capture reproduced the invalid release argument in an audio callback while draining a DPC-managed list. The corrected loading run did not reach that same cleanup path, and audible output remains unverified. |
| Campaign, controller, launcher | [--------------------] | Not yet verified or available. |

## Who makes this?

Most of the research, code, and documentation in this repository have been produced with **ChatGPT Codex**. GitHub maintainer and project contact: [@cstout816](https://github.com/cstout816). This is a community preservation effort; reported progress separates completed engineering work from game behavior that has actually been verified.

## Technical approach

The project uses [sp00nznet/xboxrecomp](https://github.com/sp00nznet/xboxrecomp) for ahead-of-time Xbox x86 translation; it does not use full-system emulation. The graphics work currently reproduces a narrow splash-logo draw, while general graphics, kernel, audio, filesystem, controller, and campaign compatibility still need work. See the [development tracker](docs/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md) for what has actually been verified.

The work prioritizes campaign reliability and the original Steel Battalion controller before visual enhancements. See the [community compatibility and preservation plan](docs/community-compatibility-preservation.md) for planned controller support, campaign checks, accessibility, and future Line of Contact research.

## Performance and hardware use

The runtime uses CPU worker threads for general Xbox graphics rasterization and the RTX 4070 SUPER for presentation and a small, verified GPU-rendered splash draw. A previous runtime log confirms the NVIDIA card was selected. The available synthetic raster test was fastest with 4–8 workers; 12–16 workers did not improve it, so the current 4-worker default stays in place until a repeatable mission benchmark supports changing it. A pilot-menu sample showed 1% GPU use, and a mission-loading stress sample also showed 1% GPU use while the guest reached about 0.59 FPS. The full scene is not yet GPU-rendered; gameplay GPU utilization or 60 FPS has not been verified.
